- 136mm cross-slide travel
- 70mm between cross-slide and centerline
- 280mm maximum turning diameter
- Any bed length - depends on ball screw and rail length
- No backlash
- 15mm linear rails, 12mm ball screws, NEMA23 motors
- GT3 belts for quiet operation
- Tapered roller bearings or ball bearings
- 4 vibration dampening features
- Integrated spindle lock and magnet bed covers
- Manual operation and CNC with or without PC

## Core ideas

- Commercial CNC lathes are too expensive, heavy, complicated, vendor-locked, hard to repair
- Commercial manual lathes use antiquated tech with most parts needing replacement for a CNC upgrade
- Mass-produced precision parts (motors, linear rails, ball screws) are cheap
- Precision lathe body can be 3D-printed
- Rigidity can be achieved by adding low-precision steel, epoxy and cement
- Custom metal parts can be ordered online for reasonable money
- [DIY digital lathe controllers exist](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels)
- Select and modify the modules - motors, bed length, tool posts, bearings
- Iterate and improve, share your knowledge and results for others to reproduce

## Audience

- People who like to make their own tools
- 3D printing enthusiasts looking to expand their machine park
- Craftsmen with specific requirements unmet by the commercially available lathes

People who's needs might not be met by this project:

- Need a good lathe quickly to get actual work done
- Hot/freezing/dusty/sunny workshops
- Need to feel the pressure feedback on the handwheels
- Need a machine meeting local machinery regulations
