Decide the bed length of your future lathe. By default it's 680mm. It affects:

- length of the base pipe (680mm default)
- length of the long pair of 15mm rails (500mm default)
- length of the long leadscrew (450mm default)

You can increase or decrease all of the above lengths together in steps of 50mm.

## Preparing the steel tube

- [160x80x4mm steel tube](https://www.ebay.de/itm/132751662693?var=432062251186), 28€
- Pre-mixed concrete 25kg, 8€
- 2 M10 threaded rods 1m, 9€
- Optional [4 rubber feet 38xM8x15mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006179757754.html), 8€
- Optional [2 pads of 12.7cm Sorbothane 70 Duro](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B005JRO1KO?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1), 83€

Tube needs to be:

1. Cut to length (default 680mm)
2. Cleaned with an angle grinder outside removing the mill scale
3. Degreasing inside to improve concrete adhesion

Rubber feet connect to the tube through [2 printed cross-members](step/Pipe160CrossFoot38M8.step) that will later be epoxied to the tube at the same time as the bed.

Tube ends are closed using the printed [end caps](step/Pipe160x80Cap1.step) which hold on friction with the inner tube weld. These caps are also used later during the concrete fill.

Sorbothane pads are alternative to the rubber feet and supposedly remove 95% of vibrations. I didn't test their effectiveness yet. Hard to peel them off, might not be reusable, less clearance for picking up the lathe compared to feet.
